These sections contain extensive information and allow users to search for specific benchmarks.For easier access, one default organic view has been created showcasing the most frequently used benchmarks with simplified filtering options.","visualizations#Visualizations:":"Each page contains various visualizations (charts, graphs, tables) that present data in different ways. Hovering your mouse over data points in the visualizations reveals more detailed information. Within each visualization you can also enter into Focus Mode available at the top right corner of each visual.","filters#Filters:":"The white boxes at the top of each page are filters.
