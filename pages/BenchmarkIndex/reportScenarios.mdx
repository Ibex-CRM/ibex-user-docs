**Step 1.** Select your Location.

**Step 2.** Select your currency.

  
### Organic Costings & Organic Performance Example:

You're working with a client in the UK, in the lifestyle vertical. The primary KPI is to maximize Engagements.

Start by selecting location to UK, currency to British Pound and vertical lifestyle.

Metric Cost visuals will show you all available metrics, to get a more detailed overview you can apply Cost Per Engagement under the Metric slicer.

  
The clustered column chart indicates that Instagram has the highest CPE at 9.84£, followed by TikTok at 5.79£ and the lowest CPE is for Youtube at 1.73£. You now need to apply the exact same filters to the organic performance page and analyze the performance."


Looking at the metric performance visual you can see that TikTok has the highest ER at 3.65%, followed by 2.89% for Youtube and 1.25% for Instagram.

### In summary:
For the highest ER, choose TikTok if your budget allows. If you have a limited budget Youtube should be considered to maximize total engagements for your spend. In this scenario, Instagram is generally less favorable due to its high cost and lower performance compared to the other two.
