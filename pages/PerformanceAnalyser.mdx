### **1\. Introduction**

The Performance Analyser is a tool designed to provide campaign insights for a campaign or brand across both organic and paid channels. It allows users to analyse influencer performance, CPMs, CPAs, engagement rates, and other key metrics. While initially conceived as a PCA data visualisation tool, its capabilities extend far beyond that.

  

**Key Features:**

*   Filtering by brand, campaign, platform, and post type.
*   Adjustable time frame for data analysis.
*   Comparison of different post types (e.g., TikTok vs. Instagram Reels).
*   Custom graph creation for comparing various metrics (e.g., CPA vs. Engagement Rate).

  

**Use Cases:**

*   Analysing the performance of a specific campaign.
*   Comparing the performance of different influencers.
*   Identifying trends in engagement rates across different platforms.
*   Creating data visualisations for PCA presentations.

### **3\. Example Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: Analyzing Influencer Performance for a Specific Campaign:**

1. Select the relevant brand and campaign using the Campaign Code Filtering feature.
2. Review the CPMs, CPAs, and engagement rates for each influencer.
3. Identify the top-performing influencers and analyze their content to understand what is working well.

  

#### **Scenario 2: Comparing Platform Performance:**

1. Use the Platform and Post Type Filtering feature to compare the performance of different platforms (e.g., Instagram vs. TikTok).
2. Analyze the CPMs, CPAs, and engagement rates for each platform.
3. Identify which platforms are providing the best return on investment.

  

### **4\. Data Sensitivity & Margin Considerations**

**Important****:** The Performance Analyser handles sensitive data, including influencer CPMs, CPAs, and engagement rates. This data is primarily for internal use.

  

**Margin:** The default view displays data at a 0% margin.

  

**Client Communication:** Be mindful of what information is shared with clients, especially in an undisclosed model where all data is based on internal costings without the correct margin applied. Always ensure the appropriate margin is applied before sharing costing data with clients.

  
### **5\. Exporting charts and graphs**
In order to export the charts and graphs from the performance analyser there are two requirements. A chrome extension that enables you to copy the SVG image of the chart and a design program to edit it. Our reccomendation is to use Figma as it makes it retains the proportions of the graph better than Adobe. 

#### **Where to get the apps**
You can download Figma from Kandji that should be available from your computer  
The chrome extension required is <a href=https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/SVG%202%20Clipboard/pacmblooebolmbakblffejfmhmnojece target=_Blank>'SVG to clipboard'</a>

Once you have these downlaoded and installed, navigate to the performance analyser and to the campaign or view you want the charts from.

Make sure the extension is active and on the chart right click and select 'Copy SVG (element)'. This will copy the chart to your clipboard.  

In Figma create a new design document and paste the chart into the document. You now have a copy of your chart that can be edited. Some of the formatting will look a little odd but there are a few simple steps to resolve this outlined in the followign video,

### **6\. Troubleshooting & FAQs**

**Q: Why is the data not updating after I select a brand and campaign?**

**A:** Ensure that the selected brand and campaign have data available within the selected time frame.

  

**Q: How do I add a new metric to the custom graph creation feature?**

**A:** Contact the development team to request the addition of the new metric, provided the data is available in the system.

  

### **6\. Feedback & Future Development**

The Performance Analyser is highly customizable. If there are any graphs or data points not currently accessible but needed, users can reach out to have those added, provided the data is in the system.

  

Plans are in place to create a client portal where clients can log in and access their data, excluding some costing data. This feature will be particularly beneficial for long-term clients.

  

The Performance Analyser is client-focused but internal facing for now, while the benchmark analysis provides industry-wide data over time. Using both together can provide powerful insights into how a brand is performing against industry standards.
