# 🎯 Performance Analyser: Your Data Visualisation Superpower

<Callout type="info">
  **Pro Tip:** Think of the Performance Analyser as your personal data detective - it helps you uncover the mysteries of campaign performance across all channels!
</Callout>

The Performance Analyser is a tool designed to provide campaign insights for a campaign or brand across both organic and 
paid channels. It allows users to analyse influencer performance, CPMs, CPAs, engagement rates, and other key metrics. While 
initially conceived as a PCA data visualisation tool, its capabilities extend far beyond that.


## 🚀 What Can It Do?

The Performance Analyser is your Swiss Army knife for campaign insights. It started life as a humble PCA visualisation tool but has evolved into a full-fledged data analysis powerhouse! Here's what it can do:

* 🔍 Filter by brand, campaign, platform, and post type and more
* ⏰ Analyse any time period you need
* 📊 Compare different post types (TikTok vs. Instagram Reels, anyone?)
* 📈 Create custom graphs to visualise any metric combination
* 📋 View all posts and ads data in a raw format

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Campaign Code Filtering 🎯

**How to use it:**
1. Pick your brand from the dropdown menu
2. Search or select your campaign using the campaign code
3. Watch the magic happen!

**Example:** Want to see how Mars Snickers' Euro campaign performed?
- Locate the campaign code for "Mars" → "Snickers Euro Campaign" (There is [a handy tool for that](https://ibex.goatagency.com/campaign-search) 😉) and select that from campaign code dropdown
- Voilà! All your data is ready to analyze

### 2. Time Frame Wizardry ⏰

**How to use it:**
1. Use the date picker to set your time period
2. The data updates instantly

**Pro Tip:** Use this to spot trends over time - it's like having a crystal ball for your campaign performance!

### 3. Platform & Post Type Filtering 📱

**How to use it:**
1. Choose your platforms (Instagram, TikTok, etc.)
2. Select your post types
3. Compare away!

**Example:** Want to know if TikTok posts outperform Instagram Reels?
- Filter for Post Types of TikTok posts and Instagram reels → The charts give you a quick picture to compare the performance
- Make data-driven decisions with confidence!

### 4. Combo Graph Creation 📊

**How to use it:**
1. Scroll down to the combo graph section
2. Pick your metrics
3. Wait for the charts to update and analyze 👍

### 5. Raw post and ads data **NEW**
Two additional tabs are now available within the performance analyser, the Post Search and Ad search.  
These allow you to dive even deeper into understanding the data available against each campaign Post and Ad. Displayed in a raw format data table, this gives a view of every available (or unavailable) data point for any given Post or Ad. This is like a backstage pass to the information displayed within the other views. Something look a little off? Not seeing data you expected to be there? You can now interrogate what lies beneath. It also provides a space for data to be downloaded for further analysis and deeper insight work.

**How do I export the data I hear you ask.** 
Once you have your filters applied look for the three dots on the right between the filters and the data table. 
- Open the menu
- select download
- choose your format 
- **and away you go!**

## ⚠️ Important: Data Sensitivity

<Callout type="warning">
  **Heads Up!** The Performance Analyser contains sensitive data about influencer costs and campaign performance. This is for internal eyes only! Always apply the correct margin before sharing any cost data with clients.
</Callout>

## 🖼️ Exporting Charts Like a Pro

Want to export and make your charts look professional? Here's what you need:

Install the required chrome extension and Figma (Design program)
1. **Tools Required:**
   - [Figma](kandji-self-service://library/items/20c3966d-fcbd-4ec3-9a7f-b041b2f453d4) (available on Kandji)
   - [SVG 2 Clipboard](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pacmblooebolmbakblffejfmhmnojece?utm_source=item-share-cb) Chrome extension

2. **How to Export:**
   - Ensure you have the extension running in chrome
   - Right-click your chart
   - Select 'Copy SVG (element)'
   - Paste into Figma
   - Edit and polish to perfection

<Callout type="warning">
  **Gotcha Moment** The SVG 2 Clipboard is a great tool but when you copy a chart it does **not** include the ledgend 😔 so you will need to re-create that in the design.
