## 🎯 What Makes Campaign Search Special?

This tool is your access point to all campaigns imported into Ibex. It enables you to search and filter through our campaign history and giving you access to top level campaign details, campaign activations breakdown and a list of channels used and an outline of posts generated. It's your personal campaign librarian! 📚

### 🤔 Your Campaign Questions Answered

Campaign Search is designed to help you find answers to questions like:
- 🏢 Which campaigns have we delivered for [brand name]?
- 📊 What campaigns have we worked on in [specific vertical]?
- 🌍 Which brands and campaigns have we executed in [territory]?
- 👩‍🎨 Which creators did we collaborate with on [campaign name or ID]?
- 🏷️ What brands and campaigns have we run within [product category]?
- 📅 How many campaigns have we conducted between [start date] and [end date]?
- 👋 Have we worked with [creator handle]?

### 🔍 Mastering the Search Bar

The search bar is great for finding unique data such as campaign codes or for fuzzy matching across the whole campaign dataset like a known vertical or product catagory. If you have something specific you want to find or check this is the place to start.   

Use it to:
1. 🔎 Search for text-based information:
   - 🏢 Brand names
   - 📝 Campaign titles
   - 🌍 Territories
   - 🎯 Objectives
   - 📊 Verticals
   - 💅 Product catagory or type

2. 👥 Find campaigns we have used specific channels with:
   - 📱 Channel handle

<Callout type="info">
  **Search Strategy:** Use the search bar for specific identifiers and the filtering system for exploring and researching available categories and associated campaigns — it's like having both a microscope and a telescope! 🔬🔭
</Callout>

### 🎛️ The Power of Filters

Access the filters by clicking the filter button to the right of the search bar. There are 11 filter groups, each containing a single or group of filters. For example Brand contains both organisation and individual brands so you can select an organisation like Beiersdorf to see everything in that portfolio or a particular brand Nivea. Some also contain an AND/OR toggle that can be used to tune the specificity of the results.

1. Search for any non-numerical data (e.g., brand, campaign name, territory, objective, vertical)
2. Filter by specific catagories 
3. Use AND/OR toggles to restrict or broaden searches
4. Date ranges 
5. Platforms and post types

For broader searches and discovery, or for finding results using a combination of criteria the filtering system is more targeted and effective. As some terms appear in multiple filters (e.g., beauty appears in both verticals and product categories) specific filters here are going to be your friend over general search.

#### Sorting

Most table columns can be sorted using the chevron icons next to the column header. By default, the table sorts by date (newest first).

<Callout type="info">
  **Filter Tip:** AND filters create precise matches (like finding a needle in a haystack), while OR filters broaden your search (casting a wide net). Choose based on your needs! 🎣
